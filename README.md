## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate to spread knowledge around the world. I love [Celestia Project](https://github.com/CelestiaProject) and [IPTV-ORG Project](https://github.com/iptv-org)
- âš¡ Fun fact: Iâ€™m not a software engineer, just Iâ€™m an internet enthusiast who loves to collect data and code.  Native Spanish speaker, I have a basic but acceptable level of English.
